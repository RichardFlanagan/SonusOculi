# SonusOculi
Sonus Oculi (Sound eyes) is a top down shooter game. You play as a warrior who has found himself trapped in an underground layer full of lethal insectoid creatures. The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible and kill as many enemies as possible to achieve a high score.

The player must use their sonar device to ping the enemy in the darkness of the cave, while using their array of weapons to kill the creatures. While weak alone, they are dangerous in large numbers and under the cover of darkness. They will attack the player in a suicidal charge if given the chance.
